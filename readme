# 42 Piscine - C Programming

This repository contains the solutions I developed during the **42 Piscine**, an intensive introduction to coding and problem-solving in C. Over the course of several weeks, participants tackle a variety of challenges that cover fundamental programming concepts and algorithmic thinking.

## About the 42 Piscine

The **42 Piscine** is a rigorous program designed to immerse participants in programming, collaboration, and self-learning. All tasks are completed in the C programming language, emphasizing:

- Problem-solving and algorithm development.
- Understanding low-level programming concepts.
- Writing clean, efficient, and error-free code.
- Working autonomously under tight deadlines.

## Content of the Repository

This repository includes:

- Solutions to exercises from the piscine.
- Examples of C programs showcasing mastery of basic and intermediate concepts.
- Code written in compliance with the strict coding standards of 42.

## Note

These solutions represent my individual effort during the piscine. They reflect my learning process and are shared here as a reference for others who may be interested in embarking on a similar journey.
